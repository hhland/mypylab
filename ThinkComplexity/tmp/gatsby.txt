In 1999 Barabási and Albert published a paper in Science, “Emergence of Scaling in Random
Networks,” that characterizes the structure (also called “topology”) of several real-world
networks, including graphs that represent the interconnectivity of movie actors, world-
wide web (WWW) pages, and elements in the electrical power grid in the western United
States. You can download the paper from http://www.sciencemag.org/content/286/

They measure the degree (number of connections) of each node and compute P(k), the
probability that a vertex has degree k; then they plot P(k) versus k on a log-log scale. The
tail of the plot ﬁts a straight line, so they conclude that it obeys a power law; that is, as k
gets large, P(k) is asymptotic to k−γ, where γ is a parameter that determines the rate of
decay.
